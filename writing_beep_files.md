# Writing .beep Files
These files do not need to use .beep, a regular text file (.txt) or anythingyou want (.hi_this_is_a_realy_long_and_impractical_file_extension for example) also work as long as it contains basic text

## Creating a .beep file
You can launch note pad or another simple text editor, write your code and, after or while saving it, change the .txt to .beep.
If it is the first time using a .beep, you may bee asked to choose how to open it.
For that, choose sound_reader.bat (you may need to look for it).
